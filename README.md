# Structures and Algorithms for Go
[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/benjic/go-structs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benjic/go-structs)

A collection of data structures and algorithms for personal use with the Go
language. These are largely a product of implementation for the Algorithms class
at the University of Montana during the spring 2015 semester. The curriculum was
based on [Stanford's Algorithm Coursera Course][1].

If I were you I wouldn't depend on these algorithms and can make no warranty to
their functionality. That being said the source is released under an Apache
license letting you use it if you want, but it is not my issue if you world
comes tumbling down.
